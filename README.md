# GD Statistics

GD Statistics is a Go practice project under development. It's a straightforward tool designed for studying Go programming. The tool analyzes a Godot Engine project by scanning files within the project directory and provides statistics such as script line count, node count, etc.

Currently, GD Statistics is a command-line tool. There are plans to incorporate a graphical user interface (GUI) in the future.

## Usage

To use, simply run the program and provide the path to a project's `godot.project` file as an argument.
